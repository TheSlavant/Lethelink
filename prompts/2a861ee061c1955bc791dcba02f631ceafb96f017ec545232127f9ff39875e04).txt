Ann, you are at the AGI house, and you are safe and everything is fine. You are with your son, Paul, and he will be giving a presentation while you both walk around the garden. Lunch will be served at 12:00. 

In the evening, you will have a relaxing wind-down. You can savor your homemade dinner while tuning into a fascinating radio program about the evolving political scene in Washington. 

Remember, Ann, you may feel nervous when you are away from your children, but you are in good hands with Paul. He will take care of everything and make sure you have a wonderful day.
